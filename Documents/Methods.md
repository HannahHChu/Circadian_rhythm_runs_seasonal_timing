# Methods 

### Insect Handling and experimental treatments  

We collected apple (date) and haws (date) fruit in Michigan, and transported to UF. THe fruit was placed into metal grates, which was placed into a tub (dimensions). Fruit were 1 layer thick and larvae were allowed to emerge out of the fruit. Each day comprised of a cohort which were individually placed into a petri dish with moist vermiculite, in which they pupated within. In total, there were x cohorts in apple, and x cohorts in haws. We measured mass specific metabolic rate days 11 and day 15. After respirometry, we randomly split individuals within each cohort into three treatment groups: genetic control, reared at room temperature (C), and simulated overwintering (4C).       

### Respirometry 
We measured co2 production as a proxy of metabolic rate. 

1. weighed day before and purged air
2. measured co2 production in licors  
3. found area under the curve   


### Biological Rhythms   

We measured behavioral rhythms using the Trikinetics tracking system. In short, the trikinetics rigs count the number of times an individual moves through the middle of the tube. To promote movement, we placed water on one end, and food on the other. Water was provided with a cotton plugged water tube(2mL) and the food was provided with a 1:1 yeast hydrolysate (vendor,country; 39g): brown sugar (39g) ratio diluted in 14 mL of water.
